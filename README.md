# LLM Detect: AI-Generated Text Classification

This repository contains code and notebooks for the [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-detect-ai-generated-text), where the objective is to detect whether a given text is generated by a large language model (LLM) or written by a human. The project focuses on building a machine learning model that can distinguish between AI-generated and human-written text using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

## Project Overview

Large language models have become increasingly capable of generating text that is often indistinguishable from human-written content. The goal of this project is to create a classifier that can accurately detect AI-generated text from a set of writing samples.
